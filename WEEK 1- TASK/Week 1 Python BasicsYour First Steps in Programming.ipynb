    "Think of a computer as a very fast but very strict machine —\n",
    "it only understands exact, step-by-step instructions written in a specific language.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a computer to add two numbers, you must tell it:\n",
    "\n",
    "take number 5\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Python is one of the easiest and most popular programming languages, especially for beginners.\n",
    "Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Very Simple & Clean Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code looks almost like English.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This prints a message on the screen — easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Less Code Compared to Other Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can do big tasks with very few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Used Everywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "Web development\n",

    "\n",
    "A huge number of tutorials, videos, and support groups exist for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Flexible & Powerful\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start small (simple programs) and grow into big projects without changing languages."

    "str: Text, single or double quotes (name = \"Alice\").​\n",
    "\n",
    "bool: True or False values (is_valid = True).​\n",
